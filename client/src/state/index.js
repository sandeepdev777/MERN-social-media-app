// redux toolkit is a library that makes it easier to work with redux
// since in redux we have to write a lot of boilerplate code, so redux toolkit overrcomes this
// in this we can write multiple states and reducers in a single file. in redux toolkit we can make transistion between states in a single file
// eg: configureStore, createSlice, createAsyncThunk, createEntityAdapter
